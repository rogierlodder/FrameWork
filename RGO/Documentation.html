    <h1>Introduction.</h1>

    The purpose of the framework is to provide a mechanism to connect a server-like program with a GUI that runs in a
    different process. The server is only aware of the GUI through the Ethernet connections. The GUI can be started or
    stopped or even crash without having any influence on the server process. The framework is intended to be used for
    servers in the field of industrial control, but can be used for other purposes as well.

    <h1>RGO classes</h1>

    The GUI and server communicate through a set of objects called the FrameWorkObjects. There are several different
    types:
    <ol>
        <li>EQP: this is a parameter that is used by the server, but the values can be seen and changed by the GUI. The
            values are stored in a data structure that the Server reads at boot time. It is mostly a setting that
            determines the behavior of the server.</li>
        <li>SV: status variable: these are volatile values indicating the state or measured values of the server. They
            are
            only read by the GUI.</li>
        <li>IO: these represent real hardware IO on the server. Their values can be read by the GUI, but the IO can
            also be
            set in an overridden state by the GUI, and override values can be assigned. The types are digital I/O and
            analog I/O</li>
        <li>NTF: this type is used to raise errors that can be seen by the GUI. The GUI can respond to each error with
            a
            recovery option, and the selected recovery option is updated on the server.</li>
        <li>STP: set points are only written from the GUI to the server. </li>
        <li>Array: When data must be sent efficiently as a single block, the array must be used.</li>
        <li>Command: This tag is used to send commands from the GUI to the server. Since this command can only be
            initiated
            by hand, only one command can be sent at one time</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    All RGO classes except the command are generic must be of type IComparable struct.

    <h1>Connection</h1>

    It is the responsibility of the RGO client to ensure that the connection to the server is reliable and functioning.
    All the response times are monitored and all client connections are monitored for disconnects. Since all clients
    use the same channel, a persistent problem with a single connection means all connections are in doubt, and the all
    connections must be closed by the client to prevent incorrect data transmissions, and to signal to the server that
    all connections must be closed.<br>
    The client connects to the server using the monitoring channel and reports its ID. Once the connection is
    established the client continues to connect the other clients.<br>
    The RGOClient then downloads the objects and descriptions and signals that the connection is complete. All client
    connections are monitored, and when one or more report an error (a disconnect of a receive timeout) all clients are
    disconnected and the entire connection procedure is restarted. This is done to make sure that the connection is
    solid and reliable.<br>
    When the server receives a disconnect from the client on the monitoring channel it will disconnect all the client
    connections with the client ID and remove them from the client list. When other client connections recieve
    disconnects, it will remove the disconnected client, but the other client connections will stay in tact. The server
    does not care about the integrity of the client connections, it will serve all requests it receives. Only when the
    client monitoring connection signals a disconnect will it remove all connections from that client.

    <h1>Services</h1>

    There are five services. Each server handles a particular kind of traffic
    <ol>
        <li>ServerConn - initiates and monitors the connection</li>
        <li>FWOConn - transmits the FWO object</li>
        <li>RWService - the main service for exchanging FWO objects</li>
        <li>DescriptionService - the descriptions of the FWOs can be quite long, so are not serialized for performance
            reasons. With this service they can be transmitted once during startup after all the FWO have been transferred
            and created by the client</li>
        <li>NotificationService - This is the service used for errors / alarms / notifications</>
    </ol>

        <h1>Implementation details</h1>

        Here are more FWO properties:<br>
        Each FWO object “knows” whether is is running on the server or the GUI. There is a static variable set by the
        client manager
        There is a static dictionary containing all the FWO objects in the FWO class

        Each service can handle multiple clients.<br>
        For every request, the client includes its ID<br>

        S<h2>Screens</h2>
        Each screen has its own RWClient that is switched on and off when the screen gets or loses focus. Each
        application can therefore have many different clients that service many different screens or services.
